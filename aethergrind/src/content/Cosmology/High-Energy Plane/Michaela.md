Michaela is an archangel who guards the Gates of Arcadia.

There is no known way to harm or kill Michaela.

Michaela does not have a set appearance and change in shape from interaction to interaction.

Michaela does not speak and only open and closes the Gates of Arcadia.

These gates cannot be opened by anyone other than Michaela and should anyone try to open the gates Michaela either kills or removes them from the plane.

Should anyone ask Michaela will open the gate and escort them through, closing the gate behind them before returning to her position outside, guarding the gate. No one who has entered through the Gates of Arcadia has ever returned.
