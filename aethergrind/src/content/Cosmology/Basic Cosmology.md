Planes:
* Emergent Plane (Aein)
	* The one we all live in.
	* Supports life and has the lowest level of entropy.
	* Assumed to be a combination of the 4 outer planes.
* Elemental Plane (Elemental Plane)
	* Composed of fundamental elemental particles.
	* Intermolecular forces are standard but force between different elemental molecules is significantly weakened.
	* Cannot support any form of life, complex or otherwise.
* Composite Plane (Feywild)
	* Composed almost entirely of complex formations.
	* Forces between different elemental molecules is standard but forces between similar elemental molecules is decreased.
	* Strangely, almost all substantial formations are biological in nature.
* High-Energy Plane (Arcadia)
	* Most particles are highly energized, resulting in intense heat and radiation.
	* It is unknown if dangerous conditions exist past the Gates of Arcadia but life is understood to be in abundance beyond the gate.
	* Gates of Arcadia guarded by the archangel Michaela.
* Low-Energy Plane (Acheron)
	* Both thermal and kinetic energy does not appear to exist naturally in the plane and other forms of energy exist only in small quantities.
	* It is unknown if conditions exist beyond the river Styx, though it is understood that life does exist on the other side.
	* The only known means of passage is via the aberrant riverman Charon.
