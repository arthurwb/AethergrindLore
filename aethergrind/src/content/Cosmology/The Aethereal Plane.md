The aethereal plane is the psychic space which connects the minds of all creatures to the aura of the material world. There are some creatures and mages who are able to condense their own mind and traverse the aethereal plane. The aethereal plane often resembles the material plane, though it is constructed by the perceptions of intelligent creatures, so if enough people perceive a thing to be a certain way, that is how it is represented in the aethereal plane.
