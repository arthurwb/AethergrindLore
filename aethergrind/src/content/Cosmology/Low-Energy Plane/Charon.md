Charon is the riverman who works the small boat which is used to ferry people across the river Styx.

Charon looks to be around 70 years old, slightly balding, and with a thin frame. He wears the same thin dark robe which covers his entire body save for his face, hands, and feet.

Charon is amiable and enjoys conversation, though no amount of coercion has been successful in extracting information about the nature of Acheron. He has a grandfatherly attitude and treats in a friendly, though somewhat demeaning, way.

Charon will ferry any single person across the river and will not prevent attempts to cross the river without him. The river itself has extremely necrotic qualities and destroys anything which touches it after a few moments. The stones around the river are completely impervious to damage, preventing tunneling under the river. The air above what appears to be the center of the river holds similar necrotic traits to the water, causing destruction to anything that passes through it. Strangely, creatures which are ferried across by Charon are not affected by this effect.

No form of settlement has ever been able to be established as, inexplicably, structures and creatures left on the bank of the river for too long disappear. Charon has neglected to provide reason for these disappearances. 

In the few cases where Charon felt he was in "danger" or felt that Acheron was being mistreated in some way, he has used unknown forms of magic to destroy or remove creatures
