Early Rotocomms relied on two groups or individuals who owned a Rotocomm to get together and configure their Rotocomms to connect to the other person's setup. Modernly, most Rotocomms rely on companies which manage huge repositories of Rotocomms and connects them on a client by client basis. Because of the lucrative nature of the business, there are many different companies which manage and operate Comm stations which route communications between different Rotocomms. Each of these companies charge for each line connection and charge monthly or weekly fees for their service. This is another reason why the average person does not own a personal Comm device.
