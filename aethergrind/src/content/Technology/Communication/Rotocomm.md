The Rotocomm was originally an improvement upon the rare sending stone. These stones were shrunk and made more efficient until they were effectively small metal plates which were magically linked. These plates would be placed in stationary locations and used to communicate between two locations. The Rotocomm is an advancement on this, where as the sending plates were limited to only one connection, the Rotocomm allowed for the user to switch between a limited number of sending plates within the same system. Because of the circular and rotary nature of the mechanism which switched the sending plates, it was given the name Rotocomm.

Since then the device has undergone countless revisions and the rotary nature of the Rotocomm has been discarded, though the name still remains. Currently Rotocomms are used as hubs for dozens or sometimes hundreds of smaller comms which link to the central Rotocomm which then transmits the user's voice to the selected counterpoint Rotocomm.

Because of the complexity of the Rotocomm system, most people only gain access through public access Rotocomms which have limited connectivity, or through a Rotocomm managed by a group which can afford to the large upfront cost.
