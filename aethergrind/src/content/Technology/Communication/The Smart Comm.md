In recent history (the last 20 years) there have been more and more ICE devices integrating Comms allowing for ICE to serve also as a communications device. Along with this, many companies have taken the extra step and started integrating other features into the ICE like calculators, weather alert systems, clocks, or even games. While many view these additions as superfluous, many have been allured by them and these new Smart Comms have become a sign of wealth and status.
