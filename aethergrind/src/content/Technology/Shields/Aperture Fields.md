Something something direct energy or force or something into a single small point. Make that one point really strong and its as if you covered a whole area in that super strong thing. Even better make the point be tied to some kind of counter system so instead of something needing to absorb the energy the force is negated by an opposite force or energy or something. Destructive interference or Newton's third law, whatever makes more sense I guess.
