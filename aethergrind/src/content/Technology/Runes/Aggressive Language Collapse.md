## Logical Token Streams
Original Text: The city collapsed after years of neglect, corruption, and environmental stress.

CTY:Δ↓<-{NGLCT|CRRPTN|ENV_STRSS}[t+]

In the process of converting language into runes, this is the first stage where the concept of a sentence fully collapses and instead the spell is represented instead by streams of tokens. While still readable, the stream relies more on specified rules and grammar which would not normally work for a written language.
## Microglyph lattices
While very similar to LTSs grammatically, lattices use hundreds of simple symbols to represent common ideas. In the above sentence, the concept of neglect, corruption, and environmental stress might individually be converted into micro glyphs which take up an extremely small amount of space.

These micro glyphs do not visually look like what they are representing, they are instead designed to be unique, so someone who is trained can look at the glyphs and understand the lattice. Often times ideas or more specific nouns are either described using a collection of more common glyphs or just written out (something which is often avoided due to the space that the text can take up).

These glyphs are arraigned in a set lattice which denotes sections, beginning, separations, and endings, removing the need for classical punctuation.

The main purpose of the autoscribe is to convert spells written in more human readable runes, into a lattice which can then be attached to an object and activated.
