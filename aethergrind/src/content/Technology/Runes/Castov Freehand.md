Linear Polygonal Freehand Runes

A popular form of freehand runes which relies on the use of geometric symbols to represent spells. As with all freehand runic systems the grammar is very limited, but because of the ease of use many scribes use freehand runes like Castov Freehand as a quick way to use runic magic when away from a autoscribe.
