All spells are empowered by 2 basic principals: understanding and will. With normal spells, the understanding and the will power of the caster is the main factor considered when determining if a spell can be cast. If a wizard is lacking in either their understanding (incorrect arcane grammar or knowledge pertaining to the effect meant to be created) or their will (a fundamental lack of soul or attunement with aura) then their spells will likely not work, produce unexpected effects, or even draw too much on the caster's soul and destroy them.

For runes this process is made even more complicated because there is not a single person casting the spell. Instead the understanding must be entirely spelled out with the runes and the will must be supplemented with increased amount of aura.

When casting a spell, 99% of the actual understanding of the spell comes innately from the caster, basic concepts like light and gravity are so engrained into our minds that when casting a spell we do not need to explain what gravity is and how it effects the world around us. With runes, there is no foundation for these innate concepts, and as such they must be full described for the spell to understand how to interact with the world. This obviously makes the creation of runic sequences very time consuming. The benefit comes from the fact that these sequences can be infinitely replicated and can be repeatedly cast if provided with enough aura.
