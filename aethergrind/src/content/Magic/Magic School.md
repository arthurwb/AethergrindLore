In general the best way to understand the different schools of magic are based on how aura is used and then the effects created by the spell or magic.
* **Evocation**
	* Expending aura to create new energy.
* **Transmutation**
	* Expending aura to change mass.
* **Conjuration**
	* Expending aura to change the location of mass.
* **Animation**
	* Catalyzing aura to change aura.
* **Annihilation**
	* Catalyzing aura to destroy aura.
* **Thaumaturgy**
	* Traversing aura to communicate with nature.
* **Theurgy**
	* Traversing aura to communicate with the divine.

A good way to explain the different ways aura is used is via a cooking analogy
* In evocation, transmutation, and conjuration, the aura is like the flame used to cook the food. The flame is expended in order to create change in the food.
* In animation and annihilation the aura is like an ingredient that substantially changes the meal. Like adding flour to a fat to create a roux, the flour is still there and part of the food, though it has been changed into something new.
* In thaumaturgy and theurgy the aura is like a paper plate. while in the end no one is eating the plate, it is necessary for carrying the food to the person eating. Then, at the end of the meal, the plate is discarded.

In the three categories of magic, each interacts with the nature of will and an understanding of aura. Evocation, transmutation, and conjuration all rely heavily on the individual's understanding of natural laws and their interactions with aura. Animation and annihilation both rely on a person's understanding of the nature of aura and also their own internal relationship with aura (sometimes referred to as a 6th sense, or "the feeling"). Thaumaturgy and theurgy require little to no in-depth understanding of aura or physics and instead fully relies upon a persons own feeling and ability to instinctively connect to aura and allow for their consciousness to form the aura and send it elsewhere.

These three primary schools are broken up into Logological Magic (Evocation, Transmutation, Conjuration), Ethological Magic (Animation, Annihilation), and Pathological Magic (Thaumaturgy, Theurgy)
