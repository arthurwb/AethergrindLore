The Kindman is the mascot and main method of marketing used by Wonderful Entertainment, though it is often contracted out to other companies and governments for advertising or other forms of social engineering.

The Kindman is a humanoid creature originally a human working as an intern for Wonderful Entertainment. The Kindman has been augmented and biologically altered to become the perfect person, with their mind completely erased, making him completely subservient.

The Kindman has been designed in both physicality and personality to be the perfect citizen. In his many incarnation he has a wonderful job, pays his taxes on time, follows the law, and spends as much money as he can buying products.

He is meant to be a model of what the average person strives for and is presented as the most efficient means to lifelong happiness.

Higher class individuals are not as exposed to the Kindman and as such see it as a product of the masses. Most people in the lower class tend to see through the charade, with the Kindman becoming a kind of boogieman. The middle class is the main target demographic of the Kindman with many seeing him as a fun mascot and either willfully or otherwise look past his more sinister undertones.
