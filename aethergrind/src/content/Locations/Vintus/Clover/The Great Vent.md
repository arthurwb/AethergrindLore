Because most of Clover Station's industry takes place underground, the steam and gasses that come from them needs to be vented out. Because the wealthy enjoying building their homes in the towers that make up Clover Station's upper regions, the gasses cannot be vented directly upwards. Instead, the gasses are vented  a few miles west along the river. What was at first a collection of vents all leading back to the lower districts of Clover Station has since evolved into a single huge vent which constantly spews toxic gas and smoke.

While the Great Vent is regularly guarded, so long as someone can slip past the few guards stationed around the vent they are able to enter and traverse the vent's unguarded interior. Because of this many smugglers will don protective gear and use the vent as a means to get items in and out of the city. Many more prolific smugglers have long standing deals with the guards who watch the vent and can come and go as they please so long they do not make it obvious.
