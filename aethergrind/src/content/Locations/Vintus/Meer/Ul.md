The Great Lake of Ul, or simply Ul, is the largest lake in the world and takes up around 80-90% of the area of the region of Meer.

The lake itself is unique both for its size and the unique algae found within.

While most trading between Losk'annon and the rest of the world is done via the western coast, some materials are shipped south, through Meer and often over Ul.
