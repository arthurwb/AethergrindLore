The fish of the Lake Ul have the unique attribute of having blood which is highly saturated with aura, making them extremely useful in pharmaceutical manufacturing. This along with the significant religious importance placed on the lake and the consumption of the fish has lead to the Lake Ul becoming almost entirely saturated with Greska as the people of Meer obsessively breed and release the fish back into the lake.
