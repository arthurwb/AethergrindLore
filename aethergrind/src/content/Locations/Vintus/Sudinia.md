While Sudinia may have changed hands and names over the centuries and after the fall of Maldantis their eternal enemy, Sudinia has firmly established itself as the strongest nation in Vintus. Any company of any significance has their headquarters in the city of Barpool and is money is trading hands then it is doing so through Barpool trusts and banks.

While externally there appears a rising rivalry between Onglive in the east and Sudinia, any who work in the corporate sector of either country know that both are just two arms of a much larger and much more all-consuming corporate entity.
