Originally a part of Kir and still culturally Kir, Clover seceded itself from the rest of Kir with the belief that their people were being mistreated by a government which did not take advantage of their strategic location. The mayor of Clover Station became the de-facto ruler and after trade agreements with Ostwic, Losk'annon, and distant Ban, the fledgling country quickly rose to its current status as economic center of western Vintus.
