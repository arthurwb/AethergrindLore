Losk'annon has a history of thousands of years of war between the dwarves who inhabit the mountains and the elves who live on top of them. Thousands of years eventually lead to a generation of both elves and dwarves who desired peace between the two groups and after years of discussion and change of policy, the provisional government of Zek'el was formed. This would eventually expand into the entire country of Losk'annon and the tenuous peace between the two groups would help to build the country and regions into the leading nation of north-western Vintus.
