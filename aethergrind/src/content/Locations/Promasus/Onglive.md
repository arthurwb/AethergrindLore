Onglive became mostly as an agricultural center, though because of the iron deficient soil had never been able to establish itself on the world stage, mostly just fighting to not be consumed by Promasus. Around 200 years ago, around the first industrial revolution, the city of Hatcher began to establish itself as a center for technological advancement. Even after the city has been entirely destroyed three times via manufacturing or scientific catastrophes, the city has rebuilt itself each time to only grow even more exponentially.

The Hatcher Economic Corridor is a loose establishment of corporations and manufacturing centers which form an even looser government. The government itself is controlled not by a group of people but instead by a set of rules established and tied to the Hatcher Economic Endowment Fund, a fund of unknown proportions which is used to fund the development of most major groups in the corridor. Interestingly, the endowment fund is held not in Onglive but instead by the Barpool National Bank.
