While technically free to leave whenever they please, the vast majority of the population is locked into a single spot, unable to afford the fees escape their current lives.

Most of the peasantry of Promasus is born bound to a section of land. While this land may change hands, the individual is seen as an extension of the land and thus, when the land changes hands, so too does the individual. While they are free to travel and leave their land, doing so requires them to pay the land owner for their loss, a price which is often more than any laborer in Promasus can afford, thus locking the person to whichever plot of land they were born in.

The treatment of serfs varies greatly, with many landowners having a more lassez faire attitude towards their workers so long as they continue working, and many others ruling over their lands with an iron fist.

While most serfs in Promasus work in agriculture, in the south most serfs are used as minors in the ore rich mountains. Even in major cities the vast majority of the population live as serfs, with companies buying maternity ward hospital beds as a means to acquire new serfs.

While serfs are not treated as people, they cannot be bought and sold. A serf serves as an extension of the land they were born on, so the only way to gain new serfs is to either have more be born on land that you own or buy more land.

Compared to the rest of the world the life of a serf looks like a living hell, though from the perspective of a Promasian serf, there is no other way of life. For the most part they are allowed to live normal lives, own their own property (so long as it is on their land), raise families, go to school, go out to bars
