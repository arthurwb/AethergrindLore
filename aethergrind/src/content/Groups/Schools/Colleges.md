A college is a school of magic which often specializes in one field or school.

Colleges are often privately funded and rely on other companies or institutions paying for their expertise or research.

While a college is considered and institution of learning, most "students" get degrees from universities before joining a college. Most colleges focus more on individual learning rather than teaching, as such there are no strict teachers and students and instead everyone is a member who can learn something from other members.

Joining a college is often a very significant moment in a person's life. Most colleges require a binding both in contract and magic, with most mages being required to sign a multi-year long non-compete which effectively bars them from working in any industry while they are under contract.

Joining a college places you in their specific cadre. A mage working outside of the college will often wear and present themselves with markings to denote their cadre. To the outside world there are many stereotypes about certain cadres, like the Durhamshire cadre being uptight and the Griswael cadre being mysterious. While many of the stories about the different cadres are exaggerated, the reputations and focuses of the different cadres draw in specific types of people, lending some truth to the stereotypes. 

The term cadre was originally used to describe a cloister of mages who had similar specialties, though as those small groups grew the term took on a new meaning to refer to much larger organizations. This said, many smaller organizations of mages refer to their group as a cadre even though they do not follow the same structure or have the same size as a college.

All colleges are cadres but not all cadres are colleges.
