The saints were mostly just normal people though there were some that had proven themselves to be particularly gifted in certain tasks and were able to develop their abilities to such a degree that they have become venerated in most cultures around the world.

Every saint was gifted a single tool which was unique to them in some way and related to their particular skill sets. These tools went on to become *relics*.

There are around *250 saints* still worshipped in the modern age, though there is a dichotomy with some having many followers and many having very few.
