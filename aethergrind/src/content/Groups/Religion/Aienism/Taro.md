Taro is one of the most significant Saints in modern Aienism.

Taro was uniquely gifted in charisma and was able to convince many people to join him in the first age.

Taro lead the efforts in creating the nation of Maldantis and the city of Maldant which would stand as the largest city in the world for ~2,000 years.

Because of Taro's charisma, ability to lead, and ability to not only build a civilization from nothing, but build the foundations of modern culture across the entire world, he was revered above all other saints during the first ages.

While Taro lived significantly longer than other saints, he eventually died at the age of 201.

During the time after Taro's death nations would rise and fall but Maldantis would maintain its position as the peak of civilization. 

Around 2,000 years after Taro's death and during a period of great instability between the nations of the world, with rising advancements in magic and tensions leading to increasingly deadly wars being fought across the world.

Under the pretense of being sent by the great creator Aein, Taro would return to take direct command of Maldantis and eventually the majority of the world.

During the time of Taro's return, he would act significantly different from how he was recorded as acting during the first age. Taro would be ruthless and uncaring, focusing only on subservience and the domination of all those under him. Bolstered by his significantly increased powers of persuasion, Taro would easily command armies to sweep over the continents.

While Taro's return would bring unprecedented peace, it was at the cost of a lack of basic freedoms.

As time went on, Taro would only grow in power. He would rarely leave his keep in the center of Maldant, spending days at the top of its highest tower, scrying the land in search for anyone who would break is law. His voice would carry on the wind, allowing him to issues commands laced with magic hundreds of miles away. Where his voice could not go, his armies would, decimating any who would attempt to stand up against Taro's new world order.

Progress would be stifled and people would be set to working fields and quarries, building their cities higher and higher. Taro seemed to only care about continuing his legacy as a builder and gatherer of people.

As Taro's power grew he would become more and more unstable, eventually rarely leaving his own personal chambers. After years of rare appearances, his bishops would devise a plan to steal power away from Taro. Upon learning of this treachery Taro would leave his keep and travel into the city. We would give a final proclamation, he condemned the vary nature of people as being unruly and bent on self destruction. He would particularly condemn his bishops as being self serving and prideful. As a final act Taro would summon all of his power and in a single action, lay waste to the city of Maldant, leaving in its place a large crater. Only those on the outskirts of the city who would still hear Taro's voice would be able to spread word of Taro's Abdication. 

The Abdication of Taro would mark a major turning point not only for the nation of Maldantis, but for the world as a whole. The worlds major religion would fracture and this moment would eventually lead to the collapse of Maldantis ~300 years later.

Years after the Abdication of Taro, his relic amulet would be discovered. While seemingly broken, it is clear that the powerful artifact was linked to and being powered by the plane of Acheron. The power of the plane fueled Taro's powers and likely lead to his eventual madness. The relic is now held in the grand cathedral of Folly under the supervision of the highest ranking paladins in the Church of Taro.

From this point forward the world would shun Taro and view him no longer as a leader and creator of civilization, but as a tyrant, fueled by foul magic.
