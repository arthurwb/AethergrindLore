Monotheists are a relatively small sect of Aienism who worship Aein directly rather than the saints.

Monotheists are often scholarly in their persuits, often trying to grasp the concept of Aein and developing their Compact Theory.

Most are considered eccentrics or mad. The religion itself may be the cause of the madness or the religion simply draws in those that are predisposed to eccentricity or madness.
