The antimana is not an sapient entity, and is instead an aberrant force of nature. It acts as a kind of opposite to aura. 

All aura which comes in contact to the Antimana is destroyed. While it is understood that some part of the Antimana is also destroyed in the process, the Antimana itself does not appear to be greatly affected or it is able to recreate itself, though this recreation is clearly limited to a specific quantity or size.

The Antimana moves, often with some kind of destination in mind. It is able to move both locally and non-locally, meaning it's mass can travel within space from one location to another and also instantly transport from one location to another, making its tracking incredibly difficult as it tends to travel to locations in the upper stratosphere or deep beneath the ground.

**Animania**:
In the rare occasions when the Antimana comes in contact with any creature with a significant amount of soul, it induces animania. The creature's soul is destroyed and filled instead with the antimana. This can cause paralysis, brain hemorrhaging, cell mutation, and temporary ego death, though the most common effect is a intense state of mania. While some are able to overcome the condition with only minor side effects, most of the time the effects are permanent.
