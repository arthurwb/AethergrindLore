STG or Sting, is broad group of extremely addictive substances known for their widespread use in the food industry. Most processed foods contain at least trace amounts of STG, which in tern slowly addicts the consumer the longer they consume the food.

STG has no flavor or taste and is able to get around regulation due to intense lobbying. Many people around the world are addicted to the chemical without even knowing it, though many more are know full well that the chemical is in their food, but they either do not care or cannot afford the "natural" alternative.

STG addiction has progressed to the point where many have taken up the habit of consuming the chemical raw or even injecting it directly into their veins. A process which is costly, but not outright illegal. 

The effects of a high intake of STG are minor and mostly result in a feeling of satisfaction and lack of hunger. With this most STG related deaths occur due to users starving themselves or due to complications with their intake method.

STG and most foods containing STG are manufactured by Biltec.
