While many "city-folk" look down upon the porters, porters serve a vital purpose in keeping modern civilization running. 

Porters are clans or groups of people who transport goods from one location to another. This is usually done over land or by sea. Porter clans create huge wagon trails, using their numbers as a way to support each other on trips through dangerous territory.

Porters are known for their love of their large carriers (called vans), speed, and freedom. Porters are often not religious, a point which alienates them from the rest of the world, with Aienist practitioners seeing their constant travel as an afront to the Divine Edict, though they do not mention the fact that their cities rely on the constant shipment that porters bring.

While every porter clan is different, they can be broadly separated into two groups, land and sea.
