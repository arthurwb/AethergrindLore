Land porters work in trains of 20-100 arcanovans (or simply vans) which haul large amount of materials from city to town to city within the continent.

Due to the danger that is present in the open road (especially in regions like Maldantis and Lechtland) they are often heavily armed and very untrusting of outsiders, keeping their clan close-knit in order to avoid anyone who might wish to sabotage their route.

Because stopping often affects their bottom line negatively and can provide easy targets for raiders, most porters choose to simply not stop and travel non-stop from the moment they leave a city until they reach their destination. Because of this porters have perfected their craft, switching drivers while still moving and refueling, hunting, and resupplying on the move.

Young porters enjoy building or modifying drakes which drive faster than their arcanovans, using them to scout ahead or just to get away from their families for a time. Many porters take pride in either the speed of their drake or the size of their arcanovan.
