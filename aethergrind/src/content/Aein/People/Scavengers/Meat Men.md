Meat men are a subset of scavengers who focus on collecting biological parts rather than augmentations.

Meat men are known for being much more cruel and sociopathic than normal scavengers. While normal scavengers kill their prey and extract their augmentations, meat men often need to kidnap and extract biological parts while the target is still alive. This is almost always done without anesthetic.

Meat men often abstain from normal augmentations, instead relying on transmutation to biologically augment their bodies, often resulting in them becoming grotesque and mutated.
