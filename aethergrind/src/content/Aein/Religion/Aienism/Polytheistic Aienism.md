Belief that all saints deserve equal veneration and worship.

Polytheists are relatively new, forming around 150 years ago.

Very popular in most major cities and towns due to the relative lack of requirements necessary to join their churches.

Their practice is much more laid-back and focuses less on ritual and more on the community aspect of the church.

There are much fewer clerics and paladins, most clergy members do not have any formal training in Theurgy and instead focus their training on sociology and leadership skills.

These church promote large congregations, often taking up theaters during their services.

Polytheistic churches are, on average, much richer than Orthodox ones.

Most polytheistic churches are just schemes to make a bunch of money taking advantage of the faithful.

Polytheists suffer Orthodox and do not believe their worship to be blasphemous but they believe that they are lost souls who are neglecting the other saints by focusing on only one.
