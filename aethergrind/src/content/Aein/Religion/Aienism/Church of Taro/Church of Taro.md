The Church of Taro is the largest sect of [[Orthodox Aienism]].

They were formed from the remnants of their church leftover after both the *Abdication of Taro* and collapse of *Maldantis*.

The church works primarily out of *Folly* in the *Maldantien Wastes*.

They teach mostly *penance and retribution*. 

They believe that Taro was a *hero in the first age* but was *corrupted during his return*. Because of this, all those that supported him, especially those that supported him after his deceit was made known, bare the *sins of Taro* and must suffer penance for this sin.

The Church holds a unique stance on items and creatures normally considered "evil". The Church believes it is their duty to not only root out evil, but to understand it. They believe that if Taro had been divine and just, his decision to use the *Amulet of Taro* was also divine and just. While the amulet proved to have a corrupting influence and drew power from an unknown source, the choice to use the amulet was not evil, it was instead Taro's weakness of will which lead him to do evil with the amulet. As such members of the Church are not restricted from practices which most churches would deem unsavory, such as the use of necromancy, coercion of demons, the use of paranormal artifacts, study of cosmological sciences, and study of fundamental laws. This has lead to most members of other religions viewing the Church as unsavory, though necessary as they are the only group capable and willing to deal with abnormal or unnatural threats.

Compared to other Orthodox churches the Church of Taro is much more open to new members joining, even opening their rituals to the public, though only [confirmed](<Lore/Aein/Religion/Aienism/Orthodox Aienism/Confirmation.md>) members may actually perform the ritual.

The Church is broken into three orders which focus on different aspects of their religion.

Ordo Custodiae focuses on the collection, study, and or termination of abnormal, paranormal, and metanormal creatures or objects.

Ordo Doctrinae focuses on missionary work and teaching as well as basic temple work. This is the largest order and makes up bulk of followers outside of Maldantis.

Ordo Pugnae is the smallest order and is made up of clerics, knights, and paladins who serve as the military stationed out of Folly. Their order was created to root out those who would threaten the Church, though they focus mostly on keeping the wastes of Maldantis in check and sometimes assisting the Ordo Custodiae with tasks that require more brute methods.
