Baseball is pretty much the exact same as it is in the real world.

There are two leagues which play nationally: the major league and the premier league.

Major League is mostly just normal baseball, no tomfoolery, only minor augments.

Premier League is baseball with magic, people are allowed to augment themselves as much as they want, there are rules around magic and using abilities beyond a normal person's capacity.

Premier League baseball does not have normal homeruns (if they did everyone would just always hit it as hard and as far as they can) Instead there are small targets in the outfield which must be hit, any balls hit out of the part or into the stands are considered to be out.

Premier League mostly follows the same rules normal baseball, with the same number of players, the same roles on the team, and everything else. The main different is that those same players do more than their normal jobs while on the field.

Catchers are often annihilation mages which attempt to nullify batter's magics.

Outfielders are often extremely agile but make terrible batters.

Pitchers are often the most heavily augmented, almost becoming not much more than an extremely powerful pitching machine.

Other positions like short stop often provide auxiliary support, attempting to impede runners without physically touching them.

Players are not allowed to harm or otherwise disrupt a player physically. They can attempt to counter any magic they are using, but they cannot attack or alter players on the other team.

Major league teams play at the city or region level, premier league teams play at the state or national level.
