Lampstone is a semi-rare mineral found deep in the crust.

Unrefined is emits an almost undetectable amount of light which seems to be produced from a natural reaction with the ambient aura.

When refined and mixed with other metals as well as given a steady supply of aura the stone emits a bright and steady white light.

Because of the odd interaction it has with aura, the light that it produces has a wider dynamic spectrum which includes UV and IR which makes is very similar to natural sunlight.

Many cities with regions where the inhabitants do not get a lot of light will use these lights for street lighting because they do not require that must upkeep (just a steady stream of aura) and it makes sure everyone who lives in those areas do not become sick or vitamin deficient.
