Copper is very common.

Iron is rare.

Metal rarities, platinum, gold, silver, then iron

Iron is considered essential for life and is sacred. Called Aein's Blood because it's red.

Iron is found in dense long red veins which add to their mysticism as being the blood of the earth.

Iron is also often found in meteors which also adds to the mysticism but also serves as a large producer of iron, with iron meteors being significant for religious reasons.

Iron rich foods and supplements are very common. Most food is cultivated to be high in iron. The metallic taste of iron is desired

Iron is found more readily in the soil than in the stone, thus allowing for plants to grow normally. Though with industrial farming, iron supplements are needed.

The soil of the coastal lands around Ban is abnormally high in iron so the soil there is dug and dredged and sold as bulk industrial fertilizer.

Tin is also more common making bronze the most common building metal.

Stone and wood are still very common for building but industrial building is usually bronze with some kind of coating or treatment to slow down oxidization.

The turquoise that copper turns into is often desired and a sign of age and thus antiquity and value. Though it makes the metal harder to maintain so it is prevented in normal construction.

Because zinc is still not incredibly common, brass is not used as often as bronze but still common. Often used for ornaments.

Because steel is not commonly used for weapons, alternatives are needed. Bronze is commonly used but does not have high durability or edge retention. Modernly, most weapons use a bronze or titanium base with a technical ceramic edge (zirconia, silicon carbide). These weapons ultimately become stronger than steel.

Copper is unique in it's ability to block aura. Copper is not perfect and bronze loses most of it's ability to block aura, but brass is significantly better, making it the preferred choice for auric transportation.

Magical hardening and treating is very common in industry and is almost always used in mass produced products to prevent oxidation and improve hardness.
