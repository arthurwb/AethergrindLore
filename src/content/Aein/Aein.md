The World that the story takes place in. Created by a god as means of preservation, creating life and transferring the survivors of a previous, failed attempt.

Aein is also the name of the god.

In modern times, Aein is recorded as only being around for a few thousand years.

Aein is truthfully much older than this, as the world had served as a testing grounds for dragons before they were used in another project. Since then the dragons have been left to die out.

Aein sees the world as a interpretational art project. As such they are more interested in just seeing how things turn out rather than investing themselves fully.

Things happen all the time that are not necessarily "Aein's will." These things relate to how Aein sees the world, should something unexpected happen, that is all part of the art.

Aein is ostensibly 4th dimensional and views all time as a single tapestry, as such things that will happen, things that have happened, and things that are happening are all melded into one from its perspective.

Aein is completely beyond comprehension, beyond space and beyond time
