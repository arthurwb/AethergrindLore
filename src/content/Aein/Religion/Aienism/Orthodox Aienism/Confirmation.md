> When someone within an Orthodox church decides to devote themselves fully to their church they will take part in a confirmation ceremony. This is often done when a person decides to join the church professionally or if a person has decided to dedicate their life in some other way to the church.
The details of a person's confirmation differ from church to church, but two things always occur. First the confirmand chooses a saint which they are dedicating themselves to, they will site holy scriptures and proclaim their devotion to the ideals of their saint. Second, as part of a ritual their bodies are cleansed in water and oil, after which they are given a new name. This new name is often on agreed upon by the priest and the confirmand but during the ceremony the priest presents it to the confirmand.
The oil and water ritual binds the confirmand magically to the church. While the magic is esoteric, in general this means that they feel an abnormal compulsion to follow their saint's ideals, to the best of the confirmands understanding.
After the ritual the confirmand then needs to go through the long legal process of getting their name changed with their local government.

In most Orthodox churches, in order to join a groups congregation fully instead of being a layperson (part of the laity).

Confirmation is different for each church.

Involves dedicating one's self to a saint over all others.

Given a new name after the confirmation.

A ritual involving blessed oil and water is done in order to bind the person to the saint. This is a magical process which links a person to specific saint, disallowing them from confirming another saint while still bound.
