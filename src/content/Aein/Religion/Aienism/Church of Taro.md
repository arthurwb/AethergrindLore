The Church of Taro is the largest sect of [[Orthodox Aienism]].

They were formed from the remnants of their church leftover after both the *fall of Taro* and collapse of *Maldantis*.

The church works primarily out of *Folly* in the *Maldantien Wastes*.

They teach mostly *penance and retribution*. 

They believe that Taro was a *hero in the first age* but was *corrupted during his return*. Because of this, all those that supported him, especially those that supported him after his deceit was made known, bare the *sins of Taro* and must suffer penance for this sin.

Along with their personal penance they believe that the strongest form of penance is the rooting out of evil. This usually boils down to rooting out creatures that they believe are evil and bare the "*seed of Taro*".

Compared to other Orthodox churches the Church of Taro is much more open to new members joining, even opening their rituals to the public, though only [confirmed](<Lore/Aein/Religion/Aienism/Orthodox Aienism/Confirmation.md>) members may actually perform the ritual.
