Compact theory, or the compact theory of everything, is the main pursuit of monotheists.

The compact theory attempts to explain all of existance in a single unified treatise which can then be used as a means to view the world in the same way as Aein.

Most monotheists drive themselves mad trying to develop upon the theory.
