The Circadian Witch is an individual who lives in the large expanse of woods between Kir, Listany, and Meer. 

She is known to have an unnatural command over the aethereal plane and can command aura with a whim.

There are many rumors of her killing or kidnapping travelers who go through the region. The truth is likely more that those regions are not actively guarded and is infested with monsters and bandits.
